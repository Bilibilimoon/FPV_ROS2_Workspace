[3.603s]   By not providing "Findfpv_msgs.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
[3.603s]   asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "fpv_msgs",

[3.603s]   Could not find a package configuration file provided by "fpv_msgs" with any

[3.603s] 
[3.603s]   Add the installation prefix of "fpv_msgs" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
[3.603s]   "fpv_msgs_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
[3.604s]   "fpv_msgs" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
[3.604s]   been installed.
