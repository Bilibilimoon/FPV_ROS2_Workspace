[4.197s] CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:47 (find_package):
[4.197s]   By not providing "Findfpv_msgs.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
[4.197s]   asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "fpv_msgs",
[4.197s]   but CMake did not find one.
[4.197s] 
[4.197s]   Could not find a package configuration file provided by "fpv_msgs" with any
[4.197s]   of the following names:
[4.197s] 
[4.197s]     fpv_msgsConfig.cmake
[4.197s]     fpv_msgs-config.cmake
[4.197s] 
[4.197s]   Add the installation prefix of "fpv_msgs" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
[4.197s]   "fpv_msgs_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
[4.197s]   "fpv_msgs" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
[4.198s]   been installed.
