[3.566s] CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:47 (find_package):
[3.566s]   By not providing "Findfpv_msgs.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
[3.566s]   asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "fpv_msgs",
[3.566s]   but CMake did not find one.
[3.566s] 
[3.566s]   Could not find a package configuration file provided by "fpv_msgs" with any

[3.567s]     fpv_msgs-config.cmake
[3.567s] 
[3.567s]   Add the installation prefix of "fpv_msgs" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
[3.567s]   "fpv_msgs_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
[3.567s]   "fpv_msgs" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
[3.567s]   been installed.
